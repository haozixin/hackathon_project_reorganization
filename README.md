# Project Technology Stack

This project is a full-stack application with a separate backend and frontend. The backend uses the Java technology stack, and the frontend uses the React technology stack.

## Backend Technology Stack

*   **Spring Boot**: Core framework to simplify Spring application development and deployment.
*   **Spring Boot Starter Web**: For building web applications and RESTful APIs.
*   **MyBatis / MyBatis-Plus**: Data persistence framework for database interaction.
*   **MySQL**: Database.
*   **Lombok**: Simplifies writing Java beans.
*   **JWT**: Used for user authentication and authorization.
*   **Gson**: Handles JSON data.

The backend follows a layered architecture similar to MVC, including Controller, Service, and Mapper layers.

## Frontend Technology Stack

*   **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
*   **TypeScript**: A typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript, improving code maintainability.
*   **Create React App**: A development environment for React applications.
*   **Material UI**: A React UI library based on Material Design guidelines.
*   **React Router**: Manages frontend routing for navigation.
*   **Axios**: A Promise-based HTTP client for making requests, typically used for communication with the backend API.
